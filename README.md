# Monad Testnet Faucet


This smart contract was developed by my partner and me. It represents a standard implementation of a faucet on the Monad testnet.

Purpose of the Project
The primary goal of this contract is to expand the availability of faucets on Monad, making the testnet more accessible to newcomers in the blockchain space. By increasing the number of available faucets, we aim to lower the entry barrier for developers and enthusiasts exploring Monad.

This contract is part of my project, Monatardio.
